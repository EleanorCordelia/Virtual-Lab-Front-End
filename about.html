                    Although English-speaking skills are essential today,
                    learning a language can be challenging for many. As
                    non-native speakers, we have faced years of struggle to gain
                    adequate speaking confidence. This inspired us to create
                    IELTS9, driven by the belief that it's possible to develop a
                    learning experience that is accessible at any time and
                    yields significant results in just a few months.
